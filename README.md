# Learning_About_Blockchain
 Projects that familiarize me with blockchain technology


In blockchain_mock.py I code a mock blockchain using python. I create a class 'SandDollarBlock' which represents a fictious cryptocurency block. 
I define a constructor of SandDollarBlock which takes in self, previous_block_hash, and the transaction_list. Using this constructor, one can create the structure of each block, containing: unique data and an original hash or digital signature.
